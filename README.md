#### Hi, I'm Sebastien ! </br>

Welcome on my github profile !👋

I'm a passionate **Data Scientist** from **France** that loves learning new things.
I'm mainly programming in **Python** 🐍 and I have degrees in Data Sciences and Embedded Systems ⚙️.

Sometimes I write about my projects on my medium blog 📝, check my posts [here](https://medium.com/@sebastienmaviel) !

Please discover my projects:

- [FINISHED ☑️] I build [here an interactive dashboard for a bank scoring system](https://github.com/MavielS/modele-de-scoring-bancaire). It shows how machine learning can help bankers to give or not a loan.

- [IN PROGRESS ⏳] I love the french TV Show Koh-Lanta and I wanted to know how fast people can change their opinions on candidates. To do that, I scraped thousands of tweets to analyse their contents ! Find the code [here](https://github.com/MavielS/koh-lanta-analyse-de-popularite) and learn more [here](https://medium.com/@sebastienmaviel/%C3%A9volution-de-la-popularit%C3%A9-des-candidats-de-koh-lanta-partie-1-ac381792e623?p=ac381792e623).

- [FINISHED ☑️] The cloud is an essential tool for data science projects, I discovered AWS and Spark through this project where I managed to create a preprocessing pipeline on an EC2 machine. See the codes used [here](https://github.com/MavielS/fruits_spark_aws).

- [FINISHED ☑️] [Here's an example](https://github.com/MavielS/emissions-energy-ges-seattle) on predicting the energy and GHG Emissions with buildings details.

- [FINISHED ☑️] [Here's an example](https://github.com/MavielS/segmentation-client-e-commerce) on how is it possible to target better clients of an e-commerce thanks to clustering methods.
